To package the app the commandline is
	$ electron-packager --electron-version=2.0.2 .


To package the app for all systems (besides mac)
$ electron-packager --all --electron-version=2.0.2 .


To package just for a 32-bit Windows computer (which is what it needs to be for the LC)
$ electron-packager --platform=win32 --arch=ia32 --electron-version=2.0.2 .
