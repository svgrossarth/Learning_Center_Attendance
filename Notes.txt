To package the app the commandline is
$ electron-packager --electron-version=2.0.2 .


To package the app for all systems (besides mac)
$ electron-packager --all --electron-version=2.0.2 .


To package just for a 32-bit Windows computer (which is what it needs to be for the LC)
$ electron-packager --platform=win32 --arch=ia32 --electron-version=2.0.2 .




A short cut can be made easily that targets the executable by right clicking at like the desktop
and clicking create desktop

Npm errors
Becareful there is an electron one but it will upgrade electron and it might make it not work so for now don't do that.

Electron Version is 2.0.2 I think it is now in package json thing
